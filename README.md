# StealthScape :lock: :key:

Welcome to **StealthScape** - the first cross-chain, compliant Layer 2 solution designed for private transactions. Leveraging cutting-edge zero-knowledge technology and ring signatures, we ensure confidentiality without compromising compliance.


## Introduction :page_facing_up:

Blockchain technology has revolutionized transparency and security in digital transactions. However, this innovation often sacrifices privacy. **StealthScape** bridges this gap, offering a secure, confidential, and compliant platform for private transactions across various blockchains.

## Features :sparkles:

- **High Transaction Output**: Capable of processing a large number of transactions efficiently.
- **Confidential**: Ensures transaction privacy using ZK technology and ring signatures.
- **Plasma Based**: Leverages Plasma for scalable and secure off-chain transactions.
- **UTXO Based Model**: Utilizes an Unspent Transaction Output model for enhanced privacy.
- **Secured by ZK**: Incorporates zero-knowledge proofs for transaction validity without revealing sensitive data.
- **Modular**: A modular design supports diverse applications and scalability.

## Technical Overview :gear:

### Client
- **Built with Rust and TypeScript**: Rust for core logic and TypeScript for cryptographic operations.
- **LMDB for Data Management**: Uses Lightning Memory-Mapped Database for efficient key-value storage.
- **RiscZER0 for ZK Proofs**: Generates zero-knowledge proofs confirming the state verification process.

### Compliance Stack
- **KYC**: Ensures regulatory compliance before transactions.
- **Future Plans**: Integrate Harpie on-chain or dynamically with Polygon ID for enhanced compliance.

### Wallet Integration
- **Metamask custom SNAP**: Facilitates seamless on-chain interactions and transactions.

### Blockchain Compatibility
- **Cross-Chain Functionality**: Any evm chain could be integrated with StealthScape. We only need to deploy the smart contract on the target chain and start listening to it.
